## Introduction to Linux

- Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture.
- Unix was developed in the 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs.
- Inspired by Unix, Linus Torvalds in 1991 created Linux Kernel
  - Kernel is the core of an operating system that interacts directly with the hardware.
- Different kinds of Linux exists, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS
  - These are called distros
  - Distros are a combination of Linux Kernel with other softwares and tools
  - Distros typically have a desktop environment which provides the graphical user interface
  - Ubuntu uses the Gnome desktop environment
  - And we use Ubuntu!

## Why Linux

1. The terminal
  - A powerful and fast user interface
  - Base commands don’t change fast
  - Base commands shared by MacOS (and Windows via WSL and gitbash)

2. Servers
  - Most web servers run Linux
  - Similar development and production environments → less problems
  - Containerized environments are practically all Linux

3. Widely used
  - Many companies use Linux or MacOS workstations
  - Linux skills transfer very well to MacOS
